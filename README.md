# sveltekit-amplify-starter

![](./authenticator.png)

SvelteKit + Amplify Gen2 (Hosting, Backend)

## features

- Authentication flow on Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Utility components for Amplify and authentication

## usage

1. Copy or Fork this repository
2. Connect your repository in the Amplify Console
3. Done

## tips

- `amplify_outputs.json` generated by Amplify CLI on build time or sandbox mode and should not be modified manually and so it is `.gitignore`d. `amplify_outputs.json` is loaded by [./src/routes/+layout.svelte](./src/routes/+layout.svelte) and passed to `AmplifyInit` component.
- Using `aws-amplify` as ssr-mode.
  - but ssr-mode doesn't look supporting social login yet.
